<p style="line-height:2.0em;">
I believe that <b>Patience</b> is my greatest strength of the strengths listed, patience is the ability to to wait without becoming anxious.
In the last three (3) years of my life I have been developing in this trait in so many ways, I have learned to be patient in everything I am doing. Especially during school, I am patient with learning, if I don't understand something at first I have patience because I know I will eventually get it. I believe that if you're not patient you will freak out every time that theres a delay.

<p style="line-height:2.0em;">
<a id='honesty'><b>Honesty</b></a> is being truthful, about something to a person(s). There's a saying that goes <i>"Honesty is the best policy"</i> that I genuinely believe in. In the last five (5) years I've have been evolving in this area, by being honest with myself. The person we lie to the most is often oursleves. I've made a commitment to be honest with myself. If you can't be honest with yourself, you will not be able to be honest with others. Ive also seen growth in my honesty by being sincere about my reactions.

<img src="../Assets/determined.jpg" align='right' width='200' height='200'/>
<p style="line-height:2.0em;">
Being <b>determined</b> is having a firm decison on something, and no matter what happens nothing or no one can change your decison. In the past three (3) years I have been evolving in this trait. Before I wasn't as determined as I am today if something happened I would of given up. But now I have developed strategies to reach my goal and keep my expectations high and this has helped me a lot with my determination towards my goals in life.

<img src="../Assets/observant.jpg" align='left' width='200' height='200'/>
<p style="line-height:2.0em;">
<b>Observant</b> is when you're quick to notice things, basically being aware. I believe that slef-awareness allows a person to understand from multiple perspectives,it also helps you to make better choices. For approximately three (3) years now I have excelled in my observation in mutlipe ways. It helped me to see myself accurately and to identify and fix my mistakes more quickly.  
</p>
<br/><br/><br/>

<img src="../Assets/respect.jpg" align='right' width='200' height='200'/>
<p style="line-height:2.0em;">
Having <b>respect</b> is important, it is reciprocal which means if you give respect you get respect. Some examples of showing respect is to acknowledge others and say thank you, listen and be present and be thoughtful of others feelings. I have excelled in this area in the past five (5) years now by showing respect to everyone.

<center><h4> Twelve Pillars </h4></center>
<p style="line-height:2.0em;"> I have read <strong><em>achieve your goals</em></strong> and decided that I could apply the methods used to achieve my goals. The first thing to do is write down my goals. They also spoke about having differnt ranges of goals. I could apply this to my life by writing down my long-range goals, mid-range goals and short-range gaols. By writing down goals in ranges it will be easier because you will know exaclty what you want to accomplish by when.<strong><em> With the proper use of time</em></strong> it taught me to manage my time wisely. I could apply this to my life by always spending my time on important things rather than urgent things.<strong><em> Surround yoruslef with the best people</em></strong> I can apply this to my life by surronding myself with people who will help me to grow into the perosn that I want to become. by surronding myself with better people it will help me to feel inspired.<strong><em> Be a life long learner</em></strong> will help me to become more successful,I can apply this to myself by not only grasping information that is taught in school but to also teach myself many other things that isn't taught to me in school.</p>
